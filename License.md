## Why This Exists

Enjoy managing your Minecraft server with ease! I built this over a few days because I'm super lazy and cheap and just wanted to use a low-cost VPS to host my friends-only server. I thought that this might be useful to a lot of people and save you from the insecurity of using RCON.

Feel free to fork if you need any special features, but please no commercial use without contacting me. Private use is OK with proper credit.

If you want to throw me a tip, I'd appreciate that (CashApp `$scyne`), but it's not required. Hope this helps!
